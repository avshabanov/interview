I came across this problem online.

> Given an integer:N and an array int arr[], you have to add some
> elements to the array so that you can generate from 1 to N by using
> (add) the elements in the array.

Please keep in mind that you can only use each element in the array once when generating a certain x (1<=x<=N). Return the count of the least adding numbers.

    For example:
    
    N=6, arr = [1, 3] 

    1 is already in arr. 
    
    add 2 to the arr. 
    
    3 is already in arr 
    
    4 = 1 + 3 
    
    5 = 2 + 3 
    
    6 = 1 + 2 + 3 
    
    So we return 1 since we only need to add one element which is 2.

Can anyone give some hints?

Description

A prospective CS student is investigating how many semesters it will take to graduate from a variety of different universities. Each university provides a list of required courses, their prerequisites, and when each course is offered. Given this information, determine the minimum number of semesters to graduate.

Consider the following example. A student is required to take 4 courses, mt42, cs123, cs456, and cs789. mt42 is only offered in the fall semester and has no prerequisites. Similarly, cs123 is only offered in the spring semester and has no prerequisites. cs456 is only offered in the spring semester and has both cs123 and mt42 as prerequisites. Finally, cs789 is offered in both fall and spring and has cs456 as its only prerequisite. The shortest time to graduate is 5 semesters, by taking mt42 in the fall, cs123 in the next spring, cs456 the following spring (since it is not offered in the fall) and finally cs789 the following fall.

For this problem, there are only two semesters, fall and spring. Always start counting semesters from the fall.

In addition to the fall/spring scheduling issues, there is one slight complication. In order to keep the dormitories full, each university limits the number of courses that can be taken in any semester. This limit appears as part of the input data. The third example below illustrates this issue.

Input

There are one to twenty-five data sets, followed by a final line containing only the integers -1 -1. A data set starts with a line containing two positive integers n, 1 <= n <= 12, which is the number of courses in this data set and m, 2 <= m <= 6, which is the maximum number of courses that can be taken in any single semester. The next line contains the n course identifiers. Each is a 1-5 character string from the set {a-z, 0-9}. Following the course identifiers is the individual course information. This consists of n lines, one line for each course, containing the course identifier, semester offered ('F'=Fall, 'S'=Spring, 'B'=Both semesters), the number of prerequisite courses, p, 0 <= p <= 5, and finally p prerequisite course identifiers. The first example data set below corresponds to the problem described above.

Output

The output contains one line for each data set, formatted as shown in the sample output.

Sample Input

4 6
cs123 mt42 cs456 cs789
mt42 F 0
cs123 S 0
cs456 S 2 cs123 mt42
cs789 B 1 cs456

You are given two streams 's_a' and 's_b' of digits. Each stream represents an integer 'a' and 'b' from its less significant digit to the most significant digit. For example, integer 2048 is represented in the stream as 8, 4, 0, 2.

Write a function that subtract two integers 'a - b' and returns the result as a string. You are not allowed to buffer entire 'a' or 'b' into a single string, i.e. you may access only a single digit per stream at time (imagine that 'a' and 'b' are stored in huge files). You may assume that 'a>=b'.

Example:
s_a:   8 4 0 2
s_b:   4 2 0 1

result: '1024'

In a Formula-1 challenge, there are n teams numbered 1 to n. Each team has a car and a driver. Car’s specification are as follows:

– Top speed: (150 + 10 * i) km per hour
– Acceleration: (2 * i) meter per second square.
– Handling factor (hf) = 0.8
– Nitro : Increases the speed to double or top speed, whichever is less. Can be used only once.

Here i is the team number.
The cars line up for the race. The start line for (i + 1)th car is 200 * i meters behind the ith car.

All of them start at the same time and try to attain their top speed. A re-assessment of the positions is done every 2 seconds(So even if the car has crossed the finish line in between, you’ll get to know after 2 seconds). During this assessment, each driver checks if there is any car within 10 meters of his car, his speed reduces to: hf * (speed at that moment). Also, if the driver notices that he is the last one on the race, he uses ‘nitro’.

Taking the number of teams and length of track as the input, Calculate the final speeds and the corresponding completion times.

Problem Statement

Diameter

The diameter of a graph is the maximum shortest path between any two nodes.

At the beginning, there is a simple grpah contains exactly 1 node. Then we add new nodes one by one to the graph. Each time when we add a new node to the graph, we also add exactly one edge to connect this node to another node which already exists.

We want to find the diameter of the graph each time we add a new node. Note that each edge cost 1.

Input Format:

First line of the input contains one integer N, indicating how many new nodes we will add.

Then following N lines. The ith line contains an integer X, which means we add the ith node and an edge connecting the Xth node and ith node.

The original node is the 0th node.

Output Format:

Output N lines. The ith line is an integer indicating the diameter of the graph after adding the ith node.

Constraints:

0 < N <= 100000

0 <= Xi < i

i is counting from 1

Sample Input:

5

0

0

1

1

1

Sample Output:

1

2

3

3

3

Explanation:

Firstly the graph contains only node 0. The first line of output is 1 because the diameter becomes 1 when node 1 is added and connected to node 0. Diameter becomes 2 after adding node 2 to node 0. Then adding node 3, 4, 5, all of them are connecting to node 1, caculate the shortest path of all pairs of nodes, the maximum shortest path is 3, so the last 3 lines of output are all 3.

Given an array A[1...N] of positive integers, you have to sort it in ascending order in the following manner : In every operation, select any 2 non-overlapping sub-arrays of equal length and swap them. i.e, select two sub-arrays A[i...(i+k-1)] and A[j...(j+k-1)] such that i+k-1< j and swap A[i] with A[j], A[i+1] with A[j+1] ... and A[i+k-1] with A[j+k-1].

**Example:**
For n=6
6 7 8 1 2 3
Only one operation is needed as after swapping (6 7 8) and (1 2 3 ) sub arrays
we can get 1 2 3 6 7 8 , that is sorted.
How can we figure out minimum number of swaps in most effective way ?

Given two binary trees, A and B, 
we can define A as a subset of B if the root of A exists in B and if we can superimpose A on B at that location without changing B. (That is, the subtrees from the root of A and the node in B that is the same as the root of A are the same),

Example:

A:

  5
4   7

B:
      6
  5       12
4   7   8   10

A is a subset of B in this case.

B1:
      6
  5       12
4   7   8   10
1

A is still a subset of B1, even though B1 extends one more level than A.

Write an algorithm to determine if one tree is a subset of another tree

The latest reality show has hit the TV: “Cat vs. Dog”. In this show, a bunch of cats and dogs compete for the very prestigious Best Pet Ever title. In each episode, the cats and dogs get to show themselves off, after which the viewers vote on which pets should stay and which should be forced to leave the show.
Each viewer gets to cast a vote on two things: one pet which should be kept on the show, and one pet which should be thrown out. Also, based on the universal fact that everyone is either a cat lover (i.e. a dog hater) or a dog lover (i.e. a cat hater), it has been decided that each vote must name exactly one cat and exactly one dog.
Ingenious as they are, the producers have decided to use an advancement procedure which guarantees that as many viewers as possible will continue watching the show: the pets that get to stay will be chosen so as to maximize the number of viewers who get both their opinions satisfied. Write a program to calculate this maximum number of viewers.


Input

On the first line one positive number: the number of testcases, at most 100. After that per testcase:
One line with three integers c, d, v (1 ≤ c, d ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ v ≤ 500): the number of cats, dogs, and voters.

v lines with two pet identifiers each. The first is the pet that this voter wants to keep, the second is the pet that this voter wants to throw out. A pet identifier starts with one of the characters ‘C’ or ‘D’, indicating whether the pet is a cat or dog, respectively. The remaining part of the identifier is an integer giving the number of the pet (between 1 and c for cats, and between 1 and d for dogs). So for instance, “D42” indicates dog number 42.

Output

Per testcase:
One line with the maximum possible number of satisfied voters for the show.

Question was "Given a pattern and a string input - find if the string follows the same pattern and return 0 or 1.
Examples:
1) Pattern : "abba", input: "redbluebluered" should return 1.
2) Pattern: "aaaa", input: "asdasdasdasd" should return 1.
3) Pattern: "aabb", input: "xyzabcxzyabc" should return 0.


I can think of a brute-force solution for this question where we add the character in the pattern and n length of the string to a hashmap and recurse over the pattern array and string. But is there anything more efficient? This was a pretty difficult question in my opinion.

Given a string (1-d array) , find if there is any sub-sequence that repeats itself.
Here, sub-sequence can be a non-contiguous pattern, with the same relative order.

Eg: 

1. abab <------yes, ab is repeated
2. abba <---- No, a and b follow different order 
3. acbdaghfb <-------- yes there is a followed by b at two places
4. abcdacb <----- yes a followed by b twice

The above should be applicable to ANY TWO (or every two) characters in the string and optimum over time.

In the sense, it should be checked for every pair of characters in the string.

---
You are given a string S. Each character of S is either ‘a’, or ‘b’. You wish to reverse exactly one sub-string of S such that the new string is lexicographically smaller than all the other strings that you can get by reversing exactly one sub-string.
For example, given ‘abab’, you may choose to reverse the substring ‘ab’ that starts from index 2 (0-based). This gives you the string ‘abba’. But, if you choose the reverse the substring ‘ba’ starting from index 1, you will get ‘aabb’. There is no way of getting a smaller string, hence reversing the substring in the range [1, 2] is optimal.

Input:
First line contains a number T, the number of test cases.
Each test case contains a single string S. The characters of the string will be from the set { a, b }.

Output:
For each test case, print two numbers separated by comma; for example “x,y” (without the quotes and without any additional whitespace). “x,y” describe the starting index (0-based) and ending index respectively of the substring that must be reversed in order to acheive the smallest lexicographical string. If there are multiple possible answers, print the one with the smallest ‘x’. If there are still multiple answers possible, print the one with the smallest ‘y’.

Constraints:
1 ? T ? 100
1 ? length of S ? 1000

Sample Input:
5
abab
abba
bbaa
aaaa
babaabba

Sample Output:
1,2

Problem Link：https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/4214486/dashboard#s=p1

At new years party there is a pyramidal arrangement of glasses for wine. For example, at the top level, there would just be one glass, at the second level there would be three, then 6 and then 10 and so on and so forth like the following image

.

The glasses are numbered using 2 numbers, L and N. L represents the level of the glass and N represents the number in that level. Numbers in a given level are as follows:

Level 1: 
    1

Level 2:
    1
 2     3

Level 3:
      1
   2     3
4     5     6

Level 4:
         1
      2     3
   4     5     6
7     8     9     10


Each glass can hold 250ml of wine. The bartender comes and starts pouring wine in the top glass(The glass numbered L = 1 and N = 1) from bottles each of capacity 750ml.

As wine is poured in the glasses, once a glass gets full, it overflows equally into the 3 glasses on the next level below it and touching it, without any wine being spilled outside. It doesn't overflow to the glasses on the same level beside it. It also doesn't overflow to the any level below next level (directly).

For example: When the glass of L = 2 and N = 2 overflows, the water will overflow to glasses of L = 3 and N = 2, 4, 5.

Once that the bartender is done pouring B bottles, figure out how much quantity in ml of wine is present in the glass on level L with glass number N.
Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of three integers, B, L, N, B is the number of bottles the bartender pours and L is the glass level in the pyramid and N is the number of the glass in that level.
Output

For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the quantity of wine in ml in that glass.

There is an array of 3-tuple, in the form of (a, 1, 5). The first element in the tuple is the id, the second and third elements are both integers, and the third is always larger than or equal to the second. Assume that the array is sorted based on the second element of the tuple. Write a function that breaks each of the 3-tuple into two 2-tuples like (a, 1) and (a, 5), and sort them according to the integer. 
E.g. given (a, 1, 5), (b, 2, 4), (c, 7, 8), output (a, 1), (b, 2), (b, 4), (a, 5), (c, 7), (c, 8).

There are a large number of leaves eaten by caterpillars. There are 'K"' caterpillars which jump onto the leaves in a pre-determined sequence. All caterpillars start at position 0 and jump onto the leaves at positions 1,2,3...,N. Note that there is no leaf at position 0.
Each caterpillar has an associated 'jump-number'. Let the jump-number of the i-th caterpillar be A [i]. A caterpillar with jump number 7 keeps eating leaves in the order 1,241,3*1,... till it reaches the end of the leaves - i.e, it eats the leaves at the positions which are multiples of /'.
Given a set 'A' of 'IC elements. 'e<=15.,. 'N'<=109, we need to determine the number of uneaten leaves.
Input Format:
N -number of leaves
A - Given array of integers
Output Format:
An integer denoting the number of uneaten leaves.
Sample Input:
N = 10
A = [2,4,5]
Sample Output:
4
Explanation
1,3,7,9 are the leaves which are never eaten. All leaves which are multiples of 2, 4, and 5 have been eaten.

You are given a text file that has list of dependencies between (any) two projects in the soure code repository. Write an algorithm to determine the build order ie. which project needs to be build first, followed by which project..based on the dependencies.
Bonus point: If you can detect any circular dependencies and throw an exception if found.

EX: ProjectDependencies.txt
a -> b  (means 'a' depends on 'b'..so 'b' needs to be built first and then 'a')
b -> c
b -> d
c -> d

Then the build order can be

d , c, b, a in that order

There are at most eight servers in a data center. Each server has got a capacity/memory limit. There can be at most 8 tasks that need to be scheduled on those servers. Each task requires certain capacity/memory to run, and each server can handle multiple tasks as long as the capacity limit is not hit. Write a program to see if all of the given tasks can be scheduled or not on the servers? 

Ex: 
Servers capacity limits: 8, 16, 8, 32 
Tasks capacity needs: 18, 4, 8, 4, 6, 6, 8, 8 
For this example, the program should say 'true'. 

Ex2: 
Server capacity limits: 1, 3 
Task capacity needs: 4 
For this example, program should return false.

Find the longest words in a given list of words that can be constructed from a given list of letters. 
Your solution should take as its first argument the name of a plain text file that contains one word per line. 
The remaining arguments define the list of legal letters. A letter may not appear in any single word more times than it appears in the list of letters (e.g., the input letters ‘a a b c k’ can make ‘back’ and ‘cab’ but not ‘abba’). 

Here's an example of how it should work: 
  
prompt> word-maker WORD.LST w g d a s x z c y t e i o b 
['azotised', 'bawdiest', 'dystocia', 'geotaxis', 'iceboats', 'oxidates', 'oxyacids', 'sweatbox', 'tideways']

Given a matrix of size N*N and a starting point "s" in the matrix which represents a color. 
Find the area of the shape represented by the color of the starting point "s".

Note 1: A shape can be anything as long as it is connected, e.g. a square, a circle, a doughnut or a line.

Note 2: It is only a shape if they are connected from the starting point.

Note 3: Connected means, adjacent and the same color.

E.g.
---

---

---
Update: OK as requested further clarifications, a cell is only a single color, it is a matrix and contains
a single value stating the color of the cell. Think of each cell as a pixel and each pixel represents a length of 1. 

The shape above has an area of 10, because that it is not a regular square but has two holes in the middle, if you do it mathematically:

(3*4) - (1*2) = 10 or simply by visually counting the R squares.

You are not trying to create shapes, you are using the starting point "s" to find the complete shape (traverse the matrix until you have found all connected pixels) and calculate the area.

If you need more clarification I can try but I think that should clarify.

State your Time and Space complexity of your algorithm.

Consider also this:
---

---

---
In the above case, the other shape, same color is not connected to the shape specified by the starting point, hence is not part of the area calculation.

You are given a string which has numbers and letters. Numbers occupy all odd positions and letters even positions. You need to transform this string such that all letters move to front of array, and all numbers at the end.

The relative order of the letters and numbers needs to be preserved

I need to do this in O(n) time and O(1) space.

eg: a1b2c3d4 -> abcd1234 , x3y4z6 -> xyz346

Consider a scenario where you open a file with your favorite editor (emacs on Linux or Microsoft Word on Windows). 
You notice that the application has a performance hit due to a recent fix made to the Editor application. 
What will your testing Matrix look like that will convey the information that the performance of the application has degraded (or improved after bug fixes and re-design)?  

In other words, the interviewer was saying that, if we had a graph showing values obtained from tests run over time for:

File I/O, hardware configuration, software configuration, graphics system, GPU, CPU etc. 

then at the End Of the Day, looking at the reports, which parameters will instantly tell you that the performance has definitely increased? 
(Also in other words he was asking the Matrix that will portray those parameters).

The setup is that we are given a series of text files which contain information regarding a code repository's commits. Each file represents a single commit and they are formatted as follows:
"
Commit #: XXX
Author: XXX
Reviewer(s): XXX, XXX, ...
File: XXX
File: XXX
...
Date: XX:XX:XX XX/XX/XXXX
"
The commit number is unique and is generated in synchronous order. There is exactly 1 unique author. There are a variable number of reviewers, delimited by commas; if there are no reviewers, that line is absent from the file. There are a variable number of edited files in the commit, each receiving its own line. The time/date is when the commit was submitted.

First design a graphical model for all of the commit data. Then describe how this model is updated when a new commit is generated. Finally, write the code segment called when a new commit is generated which edits a system that has implemented your model of the data - its input is a file name and whatever necessary data structures that are maintained by your system.

We have a list of N nodes with each node pointing to one of the N nodes. 
It could even be pointing to itself. We call a node ‘good’, 
if it satisfies one of the following properties:

* It is the tail node (marked as node 1)
* It is pointing to the tail node (node 1)
* It is pointing to a good node

You can change the pointers of some nodes in order to make them all ‘good’. 
You are given the description of the nodes. 
You have to find out what is minimum number of nodes that you have to change in order
to make all the nodes good.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer number N which is the number of nodes. 
The next N lines contains N numbers, 
all between 1 and N. 
The first number, is the number of the node pointed to by Node 1; 
the second number is the number of the node pointed to by Node 2; 
the third number is the number of the node pointed to by Node 3 and so on.

N is no larger than 1000.

Output:
Print a single integer which is the answer to the problem

Sample Input 1:
5
1
2
3
4
5

Sample output 1:
4

Explanation:
We have to change pointers for four nodes (node #2 to node #5) to point to node #1. 
Thus 4 changes are required

Sample input 2:
5
5
5
5
5
5

Sample output 2:
1

Explanation:
We have to just change node #5 to point to node #1 (tail node) which will make node #5 good.
Since all the other nodes point to a good node (node #5), every node becomes a good node.

Implement a simple regex parser which, given a string and a pattern, returns a boolean indicating whether the input matches the pattern. By simple, we mean that the regex can only contain special character: * (star), . (dot), + (plus). The star means what you'd expect, that there will be zero or more of previous character in that place in the pattern. The dot means any character for that position. The plus means one or more of previous character in that place in the pattern.

---
For example, A can have a neighbor called B. Therefore, we may traverse from A to B. For undirected graph, does it imply that B can always traverse back to A? Even if it does, if we use a hashtable to keep track of which node has been copied and processed in the queue, then the logic for cloning a directed graph should be the same as for a undirected graph, right?

Given two aligned sequences `a` and `b`. Write a function "findCommon", that finds the longest substring of the longer sequence that align to the smaller sequence in such a way that the alignment length (matching length) can be maximized. Sequences initially were of different lengths but the smaller one is padded with hyphen ('-') after alignment to make it equal to the longer sequence. The length of longer sequence is known in advance (m, which is same for the smaller padded sequence). The output is always the subsequence of the longer string.

The total number of such operations to be done is in billions. 



   findCommon(a, b, m)


Example 1:

    a = ------bixg--
    b = xxxxxxbi-gzz
    m = 12

    output: big


Example 2:
    a = xxxxxxbxigxx
    b = ------b-ig--
    m = 12

    output = bxig


Example 3:
    a = bigxxxxxxxxx
    b = bi-x--------
    m = 12

    output = bigx

Engineers at Google have decided to call any integer (+ve, -ve or 0) that is divisible by at least one of the single digit primes (2, 3, 5, 7) as Walprimes. Thus -21, -30, 0, 5, 14 etc are Walprimes, while -121, 1, 143 etc. are not Walprimes.
Now, consider a n-digit integer d1d2d3..dn. Between any 2 consecutive digits you can place either a (+) sign, a (-) sign or nothing. So, there are 3n-1 different expressions that can be formed from it. Some of the expressions so formed may evaluate to a Walprime. For example, consider the 6 digit integer 123456: 1 + 234 - 5 + 6 = 236, which is a Walprime, but 123 + 4 - 56 = 71, which is not a Walprime.
Your task is to write a program to find the no. of expressions (out of the possible 3n-1 expressions) that evaluate to a Walprime, for a given input. Note that leading zeroes are valid. For example, if the input is 1202004, it can be split as 12 + 020 - 04 etc. Also, the input itself can contain leading zeroes.
Input format: (Read from stdin)
The first line of input contains a single integer 'T' denoting the no. of test cases.
Each of the following 'T' lines contain a single string 's' (of length 'n') denoting an input for which you need to find the no. of valid expressions evaluating to a Walprime.
Output format: (Write to stdout)
Output exactly 'T' integers (one per line), where the ith line denotes the no. of valid expressions that evaluate to a Walprime for the ith input string. Since the output can be large, print all the quantities modulo 1000000007.
Sample testcase:
Input:
2
011
12345
Output:
6
64
Explanation:
For the first test case, s = "011". There are 32 = 9 valid expressions that can be formed from this string, namely {0+11, 0-11, 0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1, 011} . Out of these 9 expressions, only the following 6 of them evaluate to a Walprime: {0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1}.
Constraints:
There are 3 data sets.
For the first data set (5 points) -
1
For the second data set (10 points) -
1
For the third data set (15 points) -
1

Given a binary representation of an integer say 15 as 1111, find the  maximum longest continous sequence of 0s. The twist is it needs to be done in log N. I could think of O(N) solution. but couldn't go for log(N).

For example. 10000101
the answer should be 4, because there are 4 continouos zeroes.

4 individual numbers which could be permuted in 4 factorial ways. permutation of these 4 integers is an 0indexedarray consisting of 4 digits in some order when integers are different. the best permute of the 4 integers is by the following funciton  func(summ) = abs(summ[0] - summ[1]) + abs(summ[1] - summ[2] + abs(summ[2] - summ[3])) that would give maximum value.

method signature 
public int answer(int w, int x, int y, int z){

}

w = 5
x = 3
y = -1
z = 5

the sample permute wiht given numbers in the given function that would give maximum value is as follows.

for the 
summ[0] =  5
summ[1] = -1
summ[2] = 5 
summ[3] = 3

This should be done in O(1)time ans space complexity. My questions wordings may be confusing, but the function and sample data are perfectly correct.

Implement an algorithm to print all possible valid combinations of braces when n pairs of paranthesis are given.

I tried this code executing. I checked with System.out.println statements too. But I couldn't understand how this prints ( ( ) ). I have two questions.

2) The second if block(that is, if(rightRem > leftRem) within the else block of allParen is always after if(leftRem > 0), then how come this is able to generate 
( ( ) )

Rotate a M*N matrix by 90 degree.

Is this answer right? 

public void rotateMN(int[][] input){ 

int i = input.length; 
int j = input[0].length; 

int m = j; 
int n = i; 

int[][] newArray = new int[m][n]; 

for(int j = input[0].length-1, m=0; ;i--, m++ ){ 
for(int i = input.length-1, n=0; i >= 0 ; i--, n++){ 

newArray[m][n] = input[i][j]; 

} 
} 

} 


Will this also work for N*N matrix rotation by 90 degrees? 

The time complexity is O(N) since it just traverse the input matrix and copy it to the new matrix. The space complexity is (MN) + (MN) = So MN.

Rearrange an array using swap with 0.

You have two arrays src, tgt, containing two permutations of the numbers 0..n-1. You would like to rearrange src so that it equals tgt. The only allowed operations is “swap a number with 0”, e.g. {1,0,2,3} -> {1,3,2,0} (“swap 3 with 0”). Write a program that prints to stdout the list of required operations.

Practical application:

Imagine you have a parking place with n slots and n-1 cars numbered from 1..n-1. The free slot is represented by 0 in the problem. If you want to rearrange the cars, you can only move one car at a time into the empty slot, which is equivalent to “swap a number with 0”.

Example:
src={1,0,2,3}; tgt={0,2,3,1};

I have a list of several million words unsorted.

How can you find the largest and the smallest words that can be typed by a single hand on a qwerty-style keyboard?  Following the rules of finger placement, a word can either be typed fully on the left-hand side of the keyboard, the right-hand side, or both.  Find the largest and smallest left-hand word(s), and the largest and smallest right-hand word(s).


given: millions of words, unsorted
given: set of left-hand chars - a,s,d,f,...
given: set of right-hand chars - j,k,l...

You are given two array, first array contain integer which represent heights of persons and second array contain how many persons in front of him are standing who are greater than him in term of height and forming a queue. Ex
A: 3 2 1
B: 0 1 1
It means in front of person of height 3 there is no person standing, person of height 2 there is one person in front of him who has greater height then he, similar to person of height 1. Your task to arrange them
Ouput should be.
3 1 2
Here - 3 is at front, 1 has 3 in front ,2 has 1 and 3 in front.

/*

Random set of WORD.

Criterion : Given a word find out if the word can be broken into smaller word, by removing one alphabet at a time. 
a) all such word should be valid dictionary word.( Assume a function is there to test whether the word exist in dictionary)
b) Remove one alphabet at a time but the new word need to be in dictionary.

For eg :
restated -> restate -> estate -> state -> stat -> sat -> at -> a
fullfill the criterion. ( single alphabet assume belong to dict)
My solution below. I assume it can be done using dynamic programming or trie data structure

We have two strings: a normal alphanumeric string and a pattern string. the pattern string can be composed by alphanumeric chars plus the char "?" and "*"

We want to check if the first string match the pattern, where the ? means that every char (alphanumeric) is permitted in that position, while * allows to have a sequence of alphanumeric chars.


as test we want to check that the function returns true to the following calls.

isMatching("abab","abab")
isMatching("abab","a**b")
isMatching("ababab","ab*b")
isMatching("","*")
isMatching("aaaaaab","*?*b")

i found this question hard, since the language we want to parse is not L1 (there's an ambiguity in the parsing tree) it means that a backtrack modality must be implemented.

Took me a while to find a reasonable solution (that, to be honest i was not happy with)

You are given a doubly linked list and an array of references to nodes on the linked list. How many "blocks" are there present in the linked list? 

A "block" is defined as a group of nodes on the list with references directed at them and adjacent to eachother. 

For example

[node #0] -><-[node#1] -><-[node#2] -><-[node#3]

node[] nodes = {ref_to_node#0, ref_to_node#2, ref_to_node#3};

Is two blocks because the first block is at node #0.
Node #1 has no incomming reference. Node #2 and Node #3 have references are are adjacent so it's just one block.

Implement using JAVA: Hint: You can try using a HashMap.

Thanks.

Add a number to array and if there is carry increase array size.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
For example input = {7,3,5,3,9} convert this to number 73539, add 1 so it becomes 73540 and convert to array {7,3,5,4,0}. 
Array can be of any length, so you can't always represent array in form of in-built number format. So you have to do this summation in-place. Also, how would you increase array size in-case input = {9,9,9} so output = (1,0,0,0}

Assume, all elements of arrays are between 0 and 9.

Consider a city with 50 locations each numbered from 0 to 49.  Mr. XYZ runs a taxi service in a city. He has 25 Taxi’s to service the passengers. When passenger needs a taxi he makes a call to Mr. XYZ and give details like his current location as a source, and where he is willing to travel as a destination. He also tells max time he can wait for a taxi. In return Mr. XYZ either allocate a taxi to the passenger or tell him request can’t be satisfied within the given max_waiting time. Allocated taxi travels from its current location to the passengers pick-up point i.e. the source. This travel is termed as non revenue travel. Mr. XYZ charge passenger only for the distance from source to the destination. After dropping passenger to the destination taxi waits for call from Mr. XYZ to serve next passenger.
Let’s assume we know all TaxiHireRequests in advance. We also know the distance and time to travel between any two locations in the city.
 

Write a program which will choose the taxi’s such that sum of non_revenue distance travelled by all the Taxi’s is minimum and the number of unsatisfied requests are minimized. Also print the total non_revenew distance and number of unsatisfied requests.
 

pseudo helper structures. 
struct TaxiHireRequest{
int Time Of Request;//Number of seconds from 12AM
int Source; // an int from 0 to 49
int Destination;// an int from 0 to 49
int Maximum waiting time // in seconds;
}[200]

int location;//an int from 0 to 49
bool isHired//true or false
}[25]

I Got this Crazy Question on PHONE INTERVIEW AT GOOGLE:

Design and implement a class to generate random numbers in an arbitrary probability distribution given by an array of integer weights, i.e. for int[] w return a number, n, from 0 to w.length - 1 with probability w[n] / sum(w). Using an existing random number generator with a uniform distribution is permitted.

Example distribution:
w = 1, 2, 3, 2, 1

Example probabilities:
w / sum = 1/9, 2/9, 1/3, 2/9, 1/9

Example results:
n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

Documentation:

Class java.util.Random

public int nextInt(int n)

Returns a pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value between 0 (inclusive) and the specified value (exclusive), drawn from this random number generator's sequence. The general contract of nextInt is that one int value in the specified range is pseudorandomly generated and returned. All n possible int values are produced with (approximately) equal probability.

Parameters:
n - the bound on the random number to be returned. Must be positive.
Returns:
the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value between 0 (inclusive) and n (exclusive) from this random number generator's sequence
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - if n is not positive

Given an array A of N integers, we draw N discs in a 2D plane such that the I-th disc is centered on (0,I) and has a radius of A[I]. We say that the J-th disc and K-th disc intersect if J ≠ K and J-th and K-th discs have at least one common point.
Write a function:
int number_of_disc_intersections(int A[], int N);
that, given an array A describing N discs as explained above, returns the number of pairs of intersecting discs. For example, given N=6 and:
A[0] = 1  A[1] = 5  A[2] = 2 
A[3] = 1  A[4] = 4  A[5] = 0  
intersecting discs appear in eleven pairs of elements:
0 and 1,
0 and 2,
0 and 4,
1 and 2,
1 and 3,
1 and 4,
1 and 5,
2 and 3,
2 and 4,
3 and 4,
4 and 5.
so the function should return 11.
The function should return −1 if the number of intersecting pairs exceeds 10,000,000.
Assume that:
N is an integer within the range [0..10,000,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..2147483647].
Complexity:
expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));
expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
Elements of input arrays can be modified.

Pots of gold game: Two players A & B. There are pots of gold arranged in a line, each containing some gold coins (the players can see how many coins are there in each gold pot - perfect information). They get alternating turns in which the player can pick a pot from one of the ends of the line. The winner is the player which has a higher number of coins at the end. The objective is to "maximize" the number of coins collected by A, assuming B also plays optimally. A starts the game.

The idea is to find an optimal strategy that makes A win knowing that B is playing optimally as well. How would you do that? 

At the end I was asked to code this strategy!

Write a function that given a position returns the digit in that position.

(You could think that this sequence is an array where each cell only holds one digit so given an index return what digit is in that index, however you cannot really create an array since the sequence is infinite, you need a way to based on the index calculate the digit that goes there).

The function has to return a single digit.

index = 100, result = 5
index = 30, result = 2
index = 31, result = 0
index = 1000, result = 3

From the set of natural integer numbers
Let x = 1234 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Let y = 2410 = {2, 4, 1, 0}

Write an algorithm to compute the rearrangement of x that is closest to y but still greater than y. Both x and y have the same number of digits.

So in the example above, the answer would be { 2, 4, 1, 3 } = 2413 which is greater than y = 2410 and closer than any other arrangements of x.

And whats the time complexity of this algorithm?

Write a program which makes use of two classes named integer and character. The class integer has one integer data
member lying in the private section and one member function named input lying in the protected section.The member
function input is used to enter the data in the data member.The class character publically inherits from the class
integer.The class character has one character data member and two member functions named calc and display.The calc
function ask the user to input data in the character data member which will be a number from 1-9.The calc function will
divide the integer number (Data member of the class integer) entered earlier with the number entered in the character
and the display function will display the message “Divides Completely” in the case the integer is divided completet and
the message “Does not divide” otherwise.The ASCII values of numbers 0-9 range from 48-57.Eg. run is as follows:
Enter Integer:10
Enter Character :2
Result: Divides completely.

should be executed with their proper output.
String str1; //string with length 0
String str2;
cin>>str2; // to print the char elements of str2;
(Don’t use any string library function for the any purpose)
